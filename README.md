LaTex in R Markdown

This is Sachin Sharma, having more than 10 years of experience using LaTeX. I have prepared this document to help those students who want to learn LaTeX. I have tried my level best to summarize the commands / code so that you will be able to learn LaTeX more quickly and need not to search more resources.  During the past ten years I have prepared my own E-Books using LaTeX which are available on my website www.mathstudy.in and also my E-Books are availble at amazon in Kindle Format. 

To write LaTeX Code I have used TeXWorks, TeX Maker, and TeX Studio. I recommend you to use TeX Studio as it will be easier for you to write code and also you will be able to learn more quickly on this. 

In case you need some more help or clarification on the following documetation, you can write to me at : admin@mathstudy.in.
